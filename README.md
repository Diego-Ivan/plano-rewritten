# Plano

Plano, was my first Gtk Application, it was ugly and had obsufacted code. I do not promise this is perfect, but it is a great step forward on the first Plano, coded in GJS without the appropiate OO widgets.

Plano was rewritten in Vala and Libhandy has been implemented into the project, as well as styling with CSS to improve the UI and custom GtkWidgets
