Plano, was my first Gtk Application, it was ugly and had obsufacted code. I do not promise this is perfect, but it is a great step forward on the first Plano, coded in GJS without the appropiate OO widgets.

Plano was rewritten in Vala and Libhandy has been implemented into the project, as well as styling with CSS to improve the UI and custom GtkWidgets

Plano is a graphical Application to calculate Cartesian Plane related operations, (Midpoint and Slope). This is an application I made when I was taking this topic in school, although I'm on vacations I ported it to Vala, as well as improved code and played around with Libhandy, Libadwaita and Gtk

See my project history over here. In legacy you can find commits in spanish and some messages expressing my learning course, it was kinda funny to read them tho.
